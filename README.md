### Setting up your local instance

In your terminal, run `npm install` to install project dependencies from package.json

Create a directory named `data` in the project's root directory. `NBA5/data` is the directory destination for MongoDB's documents in this application.

Run `gulp` to start the task manager which:
  1. Launches the web application in browser
  2. Restarts the server for backend changes
  3. Lints all javascript
  4. Compiles Sass into css
  5. Performs javascript and css file injections
